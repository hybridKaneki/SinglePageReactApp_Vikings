    Contrary to some popular conceptions of the Vikings, they were not a “race” linked by ties of common ancestry or patriotism, 
        and could not be defined by any particular sense of “Viking-ness.” Most of the Vikings whose activities are best known come from 
        the areas now known as Denmark, Norway and Sweden, though there are mentions in historical records of Finnish, Estonian and Saami
         Vikings as well. 
        Their common ground–and what made them different from the European peoples they confronted–was that they came from a foreign land
        they were not “civilized” in the local understanding of the word and–most importantly–they were not Christian.</p>
    <p>The exact reasons for Vikings venturing out from their homeland are uncertain; some have suggested it was due to overpopulation 
        of their homeland, but the earliest Vikings were looking for riches, not land. In the eighth century A.D., Europe was growing 
        richer, fueling the growth of trading centers such as Dorestad and Quentovic on the Continent and Hamwic (now Southampton), 
        London, Ipswich and York in England. Scandinavian furs were highly prized in the new trading markets; from their trade with 
        the Europeans, Scandinavians learned about new sailing technology as well as about the growing wealth and accompanying inner 
        conflicts between European kingdoms. The Viking predecessors–pirates who preyed on merchant ships in the Baltic Sea–would use
        this knowledge to expand their fortune-seeking activities into the North Sea and beyond.</p>
    <p>For several decades, the Vikings confined themselves to hit-and-run raids against coastal targets in the British Isles 
        (particularly Ireland) and Europe (the trading center of Dorestad, 80 kilometers from the North Sea, became a frequent 
        target after 830). They then took advantage of internal conflicts in Europe to extend their activity further inland: after 
        the death of Louis the Pious, emperor of Frankia (modern-day France and Germany), in 840, his son Lothar actually invited the 
        support of a Viking fleet in a power struggle with brothers. Before long other Vikings realized that Frankish rulers were 
        willing to pay them rich sums to prevent them from attacking their subjects, making Frankia an irresistible target for further
         Viking activity.</p>
    <p>In the wave of Viking attacks in England after 851, only one kingdom–Wessex–was able to successfully resist. 
        Viking armies (mostly Danish) conquered East Anglia and Northumberland and dismantled Mercia, while in 871 King Alfred 
        the Great of Wessex became the only king to decisively defeat a Danish army in England. Leaving Wessex, the Danes settled 
        to the north, in an area known as “Danelaw.” Many of them became farmers and traders and established York as a leading 
        mercantile city. In the first half of the 10th century, English armies led by the descendants of Alfred of Wessex began 
        reconquering Scandinavian areas of England; the last Scandinavian king, Erik Bloodaxe, was expelled and killed around 952, 
        permanently uniting English into one kingdom.
