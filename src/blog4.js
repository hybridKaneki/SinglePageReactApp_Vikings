    Meanwhile, Viking armies remained active on the European continent throughout the ninth century,
         brutally sacking Nantes (on the French coast) in 842 and attacking towns as far inland as Paris, Limoges, Orleans, 
         Tours and Nimes. In 844, Vikings stormed Seville (then controlled by the Arabs); in 859, they plundered Pisa, though 
         an Arab fleet battered them on the way back north. In 911, the West Frankish king granted Rouen and the surrounding territory
          by treaty to a Viking chief called Rollo in exchange for the latter’s denying passage to the Seine to other raiders.
           This region of northern France is now known as Normandy, or “land of the Northmen.”</p>
    <p>In the ninth century, Scandinavians (mainly Norwegians) began to colonize Iceland, an island in the North Atlantic where no one
         had yet settled in large numbers. By the late 10th century, some Vikings (including the famous Erik the Red) moved even further
          westward, to Greenland. According to later Icelandic histories, some of the early Viking settlers in Greenland (supposedly led
          by the Viking hero Leif Eriksson, son of Erik the Red) may have become the first Europeans to discover and explore North America. 
          Calling their landing place Vinland (Wine-land), they built a temporary settlement at L’Anse aux Meadows in modern-day 
          Newfoundland. Beyond that, there is little evidence of Viking presence in the New World, and they didn’t form permanent 
          settlements.</p>
