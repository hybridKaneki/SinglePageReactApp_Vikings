    In A.D. 793, an attack on the Lindisfarne monastery off the coast of Northumberland in northeastern England marked the
         beginning of the Viking Age. The culprits–probably Norwegians who sailed directly across the North Sea–did not destroy the
          monastery completely, but the attack shook the European religious world to its core. Unlike other groups, these strange new 
          invaders had no respect for religious institutions such as the monasteries, which were often left unguarded and vulnerable near
           the shore.Two years later, Viking raids struck the undefended island monasteries of Skye and Iona (in the Hebrides) as well as Rathlin 
           (off the northeast coast of Ireland).</p>
    <p>For several decades, the Vikings confined themselves to hit-and-run raids against coastal targets in the British Isles 
        (particularly Ireland) and Europe (the trading center of Dorestad, 80 kilometers from the North Sea, became a frequent target
         after 830). They then took advantage of internal conflicts in Europe to extend their activity further inland: after the death
          of Louis the Pious, emperor of Frankia (modern-day France and Germany), in 840, his son Lothar actually invited the support
           of a Viking fleet in a power struggle with brothers. Before long other Vikings realized that Frankish rulers were willing 
           to pay them rich sums to prevent them from attacking their subjects, making Frankia an irresistible target for further 
           Viking activity.</p>
    <p>By the mid-ninth century, Ireland, Scotland and England had become major targets for Viking settlement as well as raids. 
        Vikings gained control of the Northern Isles of Scotland (Shetland and the Orkneys), the Hebrides and much of mainland Scotland. 
        They founded Ireland’s first trading towns: Dublin, Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow and Limerick, and used their base on the Irish 
        coast to launch attacks within Ireland and across the Irish Sea to England. When King Charles the Bald began defending West Frankia
         more energetically in 862, fortifying towns, abbeys, rivers and coastal areas, Viking forces began to concentrate more on England
          than Frankia.
