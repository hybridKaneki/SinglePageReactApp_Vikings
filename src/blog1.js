    <p>The episode may not have been action packed but what does happen is more emotionally charged. 
        The big revelation, of course, is Rollo (Clive Standen) telling Lagertha that he wants her and Bjorn to accompany
         him back to Normandy. You see, not only does he love her, he’s Bjorn’s father. (this point is still being debated by fans) 
         If this were true then it would mean that Lagertha  was cheating on Ragnar even before he was cheating on her with Auslag.
         Bjorn did not want any part of this revelation (he still feels he is only Ragnar’s son)Floki is also still his impish, youthful self, 
         though off in Iceland he puts his life into the hands of his motley band of settlers.</p>
    <p>Vikings returns Wednesday night, toning down the action and setting the stage for what's to come, 
      while revealing the fallout of the battle between Ivar and his brothers that wrapped up at the end of the first half of 
      Season 5. Rollo returns for his own reckoning with loved ones. And our heroes make their way to a strange land.</p> 
    <p>I'm not really sure why Vikings was split into two halves of Season 5 instead of just making tonight's episode the season 
      premiere of Season 6. Whatever the reasons, here we are, in the days following the massive battle that saw Ivar 
      (Alex Høgh Andersen), with help from Rollo's men, defeat and scatter the army of Bjorn (Alexander Ludwig), Lagertha 
      (Katheryn Winnick) and Ubbe (Jordan Patrick Smith).
I had a lot of problems with the midseason finale, and with the entirety of Season 5 up to this point. 
The battles have been hokey and unrealistic. Fast travel, bizarre character motivations, truncated storylines, and an unexpected 
dip in the quality of production and writing have all left me questioning whether we're even watching the same show that was once 
the story of Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) and is now...something else.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, I have few complaints about tonight's midseason premiere. For one thing, very little happens 
      and what does happen is more emotionally charged and less action-packed. The big revelation, of course, is Rollo 
      (Clive Standen) telling Lagertha that he wants her and Bjorn to accompany him back to Normandy. You see, not only 
      does he love her, he's Bjorn's father. 
    </p>
    <p>So Bishop Heahmund (Jonathan Rhys Myers) tells Lagertha and the gang that they should come with him back to England where
      he'll vouch for them. Ivar will find them soon enough if they don't leave. Sure enough, Rollo goes back and makes an outrageous
       deal with Ivar for riches he cannot possibly provide in order for Rollo to tell him the location of Lagertha and Bjorn. 
       Fortunately (and likely Rollo knew this) they've already made good their escape.</p>
